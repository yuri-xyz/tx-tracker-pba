    // Requirements:
    //
    // 1) When a transaction becomes "settled"-which always occurs upon receiving a "newBlock" event-
    //    you must call `outputApi.onTxSettled`.
    //
    //    - Multiple transactions may settle in the same block, so `onTxSettled` could be called
    //      multiple times per "newBlock" event.
    //    - Ensure callbacks are invoked in the same order as the transactions originally arrived.
    //
    // 2) When a transaction becomes "done"-meaning the block it was settled in gets finalized-
    //    you must call `outputApi.onTxDone`.
    //
    //    - Multiple transactions may complete upon a single "finalized" event.
    //    - As above, maintain the original arrival order when invoking `onTxDone`.
    //    - Keep in mind that the "finalized" event is not emitted for all finalized blocks.
    //
    // Notes:
    // - It is **not** ok to make redundant calls to either `onTxSettled` or `onTxDone`.
    // - It is ok to make redundant calls to `getBody`, `isTxValid` and `isTxSuccessful`
    //
    // Bonus 1:
    // - Avoid making redundant calls to `getBody`, `isTxValid` and `isTxSuccessful`.
    //
    // Bonus 2:
    // - Upon receiving a "finalized" event, call `api.unpin` to unpin blocks that are either:
    //     a) pruned, or
    //     b) older than the currently finalized block.
